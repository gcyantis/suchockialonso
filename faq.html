    <h3 class="question">When should I RSVP by?</h3>
    <p class="answer">ASAP! Please have your RSVP in by August 5th. Rooms in the chateau are first come first serve, so please get your RSVP in early.</p>

    <h3 class="question">What are the most important items to pack?</h3>
    <p class="answer">Passport and power adapters!</p>

    <h3 class="question">When should I arrive?</h3>
    <p class="answer">To ensure a free ride from Angers to the Chateau on Wednesday, we suggest everyone arrive to the TGV train station no later than 3PM.  See the “TRAVEL” tab for a link to the train schedule.  Should you choose not to take the chartered bus at 4 pm, taxis are available and cost 90€-140€.  You can catch Allo Taxis (+33 (02) 41 87 65 00) on the esplanade outside the station.  You can also rent a car at the Angers train station through Enterprise, Hertz, Sixt, Thrifty, Avis, Europcar, etc.  </p>

    <h3 class="question">How should I prepare?</h3>
    <p class="answer">We recommend downloading a translation app in the event that you need help or are not as brushed up on your French as you thought you were!  There are speak and translate style apps, written translation, and even dictionaries.  Be prepared for when you get flustered!  We also recommend doing some research on Angers.  We will have free exploration time in the city on Friday from 5-10 pm.  Research points of interest including parks, museums, landmarks, guided tours, and restaurants.  </p>

    <h3 class="question">What will the weather be like?</h3>
    <p class="answer">The average temperature for this area of the Loire Valley in October is 55℉, with a range from 48-63℉ (13℃ average with a range from 9-17℃). </p>

    <h3 class="question">What do I pack to wear?</h3>
    <p class="answer">Traditional Cuban attire is welcomed at the pig roast; no costumes or cultural appropriation please.  Watch Havana Nights for Cuban attire inspiration.  The most formal event we are hosting is the “Masked Affair” on Thursday.  Black tie is requested and a mask is required.  For the wedding, a tuxedo is not required and short dresses are acceptable.  The remaining events allow for casual attire.  If you signed up for horseback riding, bring appropriate clothing and footwear (a shoe with a slight heel).  Make sure you bring comfortable shoes for exploring the vineyard, château, Angers, etc.  The weather will be cool or cold so pack layers.</p>

    <h3 class="question">Before travelling…</h3>
    <p class="answer">Remember to call your bank and credit cards to let them know the dates you will be travelling and to where.  Also, contact your cell phone provider to ensure coverage.  Make sure you have enough of all of your medications and know what your health insurance coverage is while abroad.</p>

    <h3 class="question">Where do I meet the bus at the train station</h3>
    <p class="answer">When you come out the front of the train station (we were ensured this is self-explanatory), look to the left and you will see bus parking beyond the two driving lanes.</p>

    <h3 class="question">What will I need to pay for after I am picked up at the Angers train station on Wednesday?</h3>
    <p class="answer">Your “Evening in Angers” dinner and activities.  We also ask that you please bring cash to tip the staff at the chateau and the auxiliary activity staff (bus drivers, tour guides, etc.).  You may also want to purchase snacks at the supermarket or wine at the vineyard.  Sunday return travel from Angers train station to Paris or other far off destinations will be at your expense.  </p>

    <h3 class="question">Where am I sleeping?  </h3>
    <p class="answer">Most guests will be accommodated on the château grounds.  For those not staying at the château, please arrange accommodations with the brides.  </p>

    <h3 class="question">What is available in my room?</h3>
    <p class="answer">Château rooms will offer: toiletries, towels, a hair dryer, wi-fi, and tea and coffee.  Please request any additional items or services on the “RSVP” tab so that we can make your stay as comfortable as desired!</p>

    <h3 class="question">What am I eating?</h3>
    <p class="answer">While all meals are provided (except for the “Evening in Angers” dinner which will be on your own), it may be wise to travel with snacks or stop by a supermarket in Angers prior to arrival.  Keep in mind that French restaurants typically do not open until 12 pm for lunch and 7 pm or later for dinner and it may be hard to find a full meal at the “in-between” times (we struggled with this while looking for a venue).  Information on amenities close to the château will be available in your room.  Please be detailed on the “RSVP” tab when filling out the food allergies, restrictions, and special dietary requests questions.</p>

    <h3 class="question">Do I have to remember all of this information?</h3>
    <p class="answer">No! In your room will be a printed itinerary and any information you should need including emergency information and local amenities.</p>
