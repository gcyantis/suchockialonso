      <h3><a href="https://cholangiocarcinoma.org" target="_blank">Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation</a></h3>
      <p>The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation (CCF)’s mission is to find a cure and improve the quality of life for those affected by this very rare, aggressive, and currently-incurable bile duct cancer.  CCF has grown to become a leading resource in research, education, and public awareness.   In 2015, a global consortium of research groups, ICRN, was formed to work in concert to improve knowledge about cholangiocarcinoma etiology, prevention, early detection, treatment and prognosis with an expectation to accelerate scientific and medical progress on an international level, expedite delivery of innovative care and treatments, and improve health outcomes for patients affected by this cancer. Your contribution to fund research, awareness, and treatment development will be made to CCF in honor of Jerome “Jerry” Sahutski, Janelle’s late father.</p>

      <p>United We Dream envisions a society based on human dignity that celebrates all of our communities.  They empower people to develop their leadership and organizing skills, and to develop their own campaigns to fight for justice and dignity for immigrants and all people, achieved primarily through immigrant youth-led campaigns at all governmental levels.  Their work centers on 4 key areas: protecting immigrants, defending against deportations, education access for immigrants, and protecting LGBTQ immigrants. At the core, their campaigns develop leaders, strengthen organizing, advocacy, and lobbying capacities, and build movement and alliances with other social movements to advance the shared vision of equality. Your contribution will empower advocates who keep America diverse and a safe, fruitful home for immigrants.   </p>
